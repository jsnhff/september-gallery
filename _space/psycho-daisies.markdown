Constance Tenvik will perform Cold Buffet, a new work commissioned by SEPTEMBER, inspired by the 1966 film Daisies. Daisies follows the misadventures of two women who, believing the world to be spoiled, embark on a series of pranks in which nothing—food, clothes, men, war—is taken seriously. In Cold Buffet, Tenvik will present a midsummers night’s dream-like exploration of the fictive character, Tricia Tranquilite, who has returned to the white cube after having been distracted by barefoot yoga-posers out in the green fields. Delusional still, she mistakes bread loafs for shoes and flowers for arrows, and hopes to avoid returning to the brutality of the every day.
 
Annie Bielski will read tragicomic musings generally having to do with family, eating, shopping, and spirituality. Bielski will read with and without karaoke backing tracks of popular songs overheard in safe public spaces: the dentist's office waiting room, Lowe's, and TJ Maxx.
 
FlucT will perform a new choreography in response to SEPTEMBER’s recent founding that will address issues of capital obedience within American culture through choreography and performance. FlucT's work develops original narrative soundscapes linking manipulated pop music with violently intimate dance.
