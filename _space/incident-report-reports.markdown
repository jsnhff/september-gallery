Incident Report: Reports 

Opening: Saturday, September 2, 6-8pm

Exhibition: September 2 â€“ October 15, 2017

INCIDENT REPORT is an experimental viewing station that has been located in Hudson, NY for the past ten years. We offer an interface between the many publics of the street, and the concepts and issues generated by visual thinkers. We engage in formally arranged projects, as well as improvised situations. 

At September Gallery we present a framework for looking at Incident Report overall. IR has been an unpredictable series of projects; a storefront space that is sensitive to a constantly shifting town. IR will migrate up the street and into the gallery to present new works and the entire archive of all past 100 projects.
 
Reports will include works by Nancy Shaver, Allyson Strafella, Maximilian Goldfarb, Tyler Rowland, Carla Herrera-Prats, Taylor Davis, Joan Linder, Nick Tobier, Edna Arloween, Chris Lee and Helen Mirra, as well as a decade of participants and a new publication documenting this project.
 
Concurrently, Incident No.101 will be installed by Bruce Dow in the IR viewing station at 348 Warren Street. Dow installed Incident No.1 in 2007.
 
The exhibitions open on September 2, and events will be programmed at September Gallery for subsequent Saturday afternoons.
