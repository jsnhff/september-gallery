**Incident Report, Reports **

Opening: Saturday, September 2, 6-8pm
Exhibition: September 2 â€“ October 15, 2017

INCIDENT REPORT is an experimental viewing station that has been located in Hudson, NY for the past ten years. We offer an interface between the many publics of the street, and the concepts and issues generated by visual thinkers. We engage in formally arranged projects, as well as improvised situations. 

At SEPTEMBER we present a framework for looking at Incident Report overall. IR has been an unpredictable series of projects; a storefront space that is sensitive to a constantly shifting town. IR will migrate up the street and into the gallery to present new works and the entire archive of all past 100 projects. 

Reports includes works by Nancy Shaver, Allyson Strafella, Maximilian Goldfarb, Tyler Rowland, Carla Herrera-Prats, Taylor Davis, Bruce Dow, Joan Linder, Nick Tobier, Edna Arloween, Chris Lee and Helen Mirra, as well as a decade of participants represented in a slideshow and new publication. Works are being added during the run of the show, including an anonymous pin and an installation in the bathroom by Rebekah Modrak.

Concurrently, Incident No.101 will be installed by Bruce Dow in the IR viewing station, located at 348 Warren Street, one block from SEPTEMBER. Dow installed Incident No.1 in 2007. 

Upcoming reading and performance programming including Catherine Lord, Anne Lauderbach, Richard Kennedy, and Jackson, will take place on Saturday, September 23, and Saturday, October 7 at 5pm at SEPTEMBER. These events will be broadcast live on Wave Farm's WGXC 90.7-FM [link to http://wgxc.org] in New York's Upper Hudson Valley and streamed online at wavefarm.org [link to https://wavefarm.org].
