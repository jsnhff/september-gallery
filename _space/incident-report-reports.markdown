SEPTEMBER is pleased to present *Incident Report: Reports*. 

*INCIDENT REPORT* is an experimental viewing station that has been located in Hudson, NY for the past ten years. We offer an interface between the many publics of the street, and the concepts and issues generated by visual thinkers. We engage in formally arranged projects, as well as improvised situations. 

SEPTEMBER presents a framework for looking at Incident Report overall. IR has been an unpredictable series of projects; a storefront space that is sensitive to a constantly shifting town. IR will migrate up the street and into the gallery to present new works and the entire archive of all past 100 projects. 

Reports includes works by Nancy Shaver, Allyson Strafella, Maximilian Goldfarb, Tyler Rowland, Carla Herrera-Prats, Taylor Davis, Bruce Dow, Joan Linder, Nick Tobier, Edna Arloween, Chris Lee and Helen Mirra, as well as a decade of participants represented in a slideshow and new publication. Works are being added during the run of the show, including an anonymous pin and an installation in the bathroom by Rebekah Modrak.

Concurrently, Incident No.101 will be installed by Bruce Dow in the IR viewing station, located at 348 Warren Street, one block from SEPTEMBER. Dow installed Incident No.1 in 2007. 

The IR reading and performance programming, including Ann Lauterbach and Richard Kennedy, will take place on Saturday, September 23 at 5pm at SEPTEMBER. 

Poet and essayist Ann Lauterbach is the author of nine books of poetry, most recently Under the Sign (Penguin, 2013) and three books of essays; her 2009 poetry collection Or to Begin Again was nominated for a National Book Award. She has written widely on visual artists, most recently on Kenji Fujita and Johanna Tiedtke,  and has made several collaborations. She has taught in Critical Writing at SVA and was a visiting critic (sculpture) at Yale. Her work has been recognized by fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and was the subject of a Conference in Paris in 2015. She is Schwab Professor of Languages and Literature at Bard College, where she is also co-Chair of Writing in the Bard MFA. A native of New York City, she lives in Germantown, New York. 

Richard Kennedy is a composer, choreographer, curator and cultural instigator living and working in Hudson, New York while attending Milton Avery Institute (Bard MFA). Richard has presented work recently at Moma Ps1, Artists Space, Danspace, & Signal (Brooklyn), Movement Research & Basilica Hudson. His projects include performing Comeuppance and Black Rage at Brooklyn’s Signal and the ballet BOTHat Artists Space in Manhattan, curating the daylong festival “Index” at Knockdown Center in Queens and Sunday Session  “FROM.UNDER.ABOVE.,” at MoMA PS1. Kennedy was featured in Artforum's Top Ten, spring 2017.

Performance & Reading: Saturday, September 23, 5pm
