On March 12, Kristen Dodge and Laleh Khorramian co-founded MASKS4PEOPLE in response to the developing crisis of COVID-19. M4P masks are made by a team of artists based in the Hudson Valley, and the M4P fiscal sponsor, Greene County Council on the Arts, is based in Catskill, NY.

The mission at MASKS4PEOPLE is to make and distribute face masks to hospitals, healthcare centers, organizations, and individuals in need for FREE. 

As of March 5, MASKS4PEOPLE has produced and distributed over 4,500 masks to over 150 different groups. The majority of M4P mask recipients are based in New York City where COVID-19 has been most rampant and destructive, and Upstate New York where the M4P operation is located. However we have also served organizations in California, Florida, North Carolina, Oregon, Utah and others. 

M4P masks are not surgical-grade masks, nor are they N95 masks. They are three-layer masks: the outer layers are tightly woven cotton and the inner layer is non-fusible, non- woven interfacing. M4P masks are machine washable and reusable. 

MASK RECIPIENTS INCLUDE:

Columbia Memorial Hospital, Harlem Hospital (NYC), Jacobi Medical Center (Bronx), Rikerâ€™s Island Prison (Bronx), Bellevue Hospital (NYC), Ghent Rehabilitation and Senior Center (Ghent, NY), Columbia County Social Services (NY), Upper Hudson Planned Parenthood (Hudson, NY), Park Medical (OR), Essex Street Market (NYC), Camphill
