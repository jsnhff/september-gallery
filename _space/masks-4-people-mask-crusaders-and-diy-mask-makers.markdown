**MAsks 4 peoplE**

With a team of local artists and makers lead by Laleh Khorramian, we are producing hundreds of washable and reusable face masks for front line hospital workers who are risking their lives to care for those in need. The availability of protective gear at hospitals is rapidly dwindling. We are working to respond quickly.

If you have any of the following items, please email us at masks4people@gmail.com. 

1/4 inch elastic band spools, or any amount

18 gauge aluminum wire, or any wire that will not rust

non-fusibile, non-woven interfacing

tightly woven 100% cotton fabric


A growing number of Makers and organizers are responding to the crisis around us. Please see below for more info.

We are calling for those with materials to donate to those in need. If you or anyone you know has any supply of needed equipment such as gloves and masks, please consider donating them to those on the frontline of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Thank you for standing in solidarity with one another.
