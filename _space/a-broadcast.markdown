For Upstate Art Weekend on Saturday, August 28, artist and activist Lukaza Branfman-Verissimo will be Broadcasting sounds, protest chants and stories of resistance in downtown Hudson.

A Broadcast: an invitation to listen and use your body to support. An invitation to come to a selected site, to gather and form a crowd. To let our bodies become the support structures. To show up, to learn and repeat and share.

You are invited to take part in bringing this work to life! From 11am-1pm and 2-4pm, at least 10 volunteers are needed to hold up banners, repeat protest chants, and engage in conversations about your resistance and liberatory histories! Please email Lukaza if you are interested in being a part of this work: lukazabv@gmail.com
