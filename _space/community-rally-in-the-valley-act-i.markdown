We are thrilled to announce the ten selected artists whose work was chosen for the limited edition set of postcards created for the exhibit ACT I in conjunction with Rally in the Valley.

After much deliberation we chose these postcards from hundreds of exceptional artworks because we feel the group represents the ethos of the exhibit; acting as a call, a shout, and a cry to notice our united artist voices standing together in support of Planned Parenthood! ACT I is a political action, gathering hundreds of artists together to share expression, to raise money for Planned Parenthood, and to raise awareness of our political concerns through the act of writing postcards to our elected officials and to one another. Postcards have long held a history of social documentation and acted as an easy method for communication before the telephone. The first US postcard was issued on May 13, 1873 depicting the bust of Liberty. Post-election many of us feel unheard, unaddressed, and unseen by our current government in this country, but together we are raising our voices and sending a strong community message with ACT I. 

With love, admiration, and gratitude,
Kristen & Dawn

PS. We are overwhelmed with awe by the outpouring of artistic talent and engagement demonstrated by hundreds of artists sharing artwork with ACT I. We encourage each and every one of you amazing artists that have contributed to this exhibit to turn your submission into a postcard, and to continue to share your art, your heart, and your voice with this government and with your neighbors. The action does not stop here, this is ACT I.

Limited edition artists:
