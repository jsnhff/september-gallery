SEPTEMBER presents *Tiny Things*, opening Saturday, February 1, 2020. Artists included are Susan Collis, Nina Katchadourian, Kate Newby, Liliana Porter, Zoë Sheehan Saldaña, Barb Smith, Julianne Swartz, and Stefanie Victor.

The overall impact of Tiny Things will be a slow reveal. Many of the works won't be discernible, or even visible from afar, requiring us moving into focus. Tiny Things is an antidote to over-inundated visual environments, and counterbalance to loud, forceful ways of communicating. It is an anti-egoic break, rewarding close attention and quiet engagement.
