SEPTEMBER presents *Tiny Things*, an exhibition of sculpture and photography, opening Saturday, February 1, 2020. Artists included are Susan Collis, Nina Katchadourian, Kate Newby, Liliana Porter, Zoë Sheehan Saldaña, Barb Smith, Julianne Swartz, and Stefanie Victor.

The overall impact of Tiny Things will be a slow reveal, rewarding close attention and quiet engagement. Many of the works will not be discernible, or even visible from afar, requiring moving closer to achieve focus, or to discover their presence at all: a miniature figurine, a loose matchstick, two interlocked porcelain rings, a solitary screw. 

At a glance, many of the objects seem found and commonplace. With closer observation, they are revealed to be painstakingly made or transformed: pebbles are glazed ceramic, a nail head is a black diamond, a loop of twine is hand-twisted, a soda tab is sterling silver, and remarkably, a spider web is partially reconstructed with red thread.

While most of the works are actually small, others create diminutive subjects with the aid of distance and an altered perspective: tiny humans are reflected in a shard of mirror grasped in the palm of a hand, trees and buildings are shrunken and inverted through a window lens. Other works draw attention to imperceptibility; the small invisible space between matter: a narrow crack in the floor, the magnetized air between a static pole and the wall it leans towards. Two dark center points of a small sculpture resemble eyes, but in fact are hollow portals that disappear into the wall. 

There is an empty white room save three tiny pieces of furniture that have been plucked from any context at all. Within the show itself objects exist within a kind of non-space: white canvas, white shelves, white walls, and within the white box of the gallery. Here we have an erasure of the extraneous, a tolerance for creating space in between things. Each sui generis object or cluster of objects occupies a singular shelf, a lone wall expanse, or a hidden pocket. Likewise, the process of each artist is solitary, often reliant upon her own hands- and sometimes her teeth.

Tiny Things is an antidote to over-stimulation, a counterbalance to forceful ways of communicating. It is a silent demonstration. It is a witness to the work of artists who engage unobtrusively and consciously within the world, introducing us to the value of attentiveness, attuning us to the overlooked and rewarding us with the unexpected. 

“I hope…..to make us consider once again, and with greater attention, that which we thought we knew.” – Zöe Sheehan Saldaña
