An intimate experience of an artwork is a privilege. To handle a work of art is to come to terms with its object-hood, to understand its materiality and impermanence. It is an investigation, a desire to comprehend a work’s own language of shape and material. From unlimited zines printed on Xerox paper, to unique works with folded inserts, the artist book cannot be verbally or visually summarized; it must be opened, pages turned, textures felt, orientation moved. From closely guarded sketchbooks to finely bound autobiographical reckonings, the artist book demands individual interaction and contemplation.

The artist who undertakes a work in book form does so in anticipation of it being held and materially comprehended. An artist highlights old tomes in bright hues with patterns set over text, both illuminating and hindering your attempts to understand the information of the original. She collects images of hundreds of births and jams them together, putting on display the raw bodily carnage of childbirth while couching it in a universality that numbs shock and induces awe. She cuts, inserts, layers, and folds pages with landscape images, creating textured collages with absences for you to maneuver. She wraps covers with fur inciting a soft and wild fragility.

Exhibition title adapted from John Ashbery’s poem At North Farm.
