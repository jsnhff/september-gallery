Exhibition Co-Organized by Kristen Dodge and Kate Gilmore. Opening Saturday, January 28. Event programming begins at 3pm. Opening Day Co-Organized by Lauren Barnes and Shanekia McIntosh.
Exhibition Dates: January 28 - March 5, 2017

SEPTEMBER presents <i>POST-ELECTION<i>, an exhibition of over 170 artists, co-organized by Kristen Dodge and Kate Gilmore. This exhibition was conceived in conversation between Kristen and Kate a few days after the U.S. Presidential Election. With the intention of providing a reason, space, and context for artists to respond to the current circumstance, they agreed to set a show in motion, and allow the call to take on a life of its own. Word spread between artists and within a short time, the number of participants rose from 50 to 170. The current list is included below.

If you choose to make a work that addresses things internal, or external, or some state in-between, that is up to you. Make what you need to make in whatever form, and at whatever pitch you choose. -excerpt from the call to participate.

If we stop to comprehend the “unrealistic” endeavors that we pursue, we would never do them. This show has been a leap of faith and a truly collaborative endeavor.

Lauren Barnes and Shanekia McIntosh are organizing the opening day of performances, talks, and events. Hertta Nilsson is handling all inventory input. Carrie Schneider is managing new media submissions. Courtney Childress, Sheree Hovespain, Eleanor King, Gina Magid, Carleen Sheehan, Elise Siegel, and Ana Wolovick are providing drop-off locations for participating artists. Lilah Friedland is hand-printing posters, managing the collection of works in collaboration with our staff, and unwrapping works. Alison Fox is distributing posters. Meg Lipke is unwrapping works and distributing posters. Kate Minford is managing works received. Adelaide Ruff is assiting with installation along with several of the people listed above. Many participating artists have personally shipped their work to the gallery and offered their time and resources. 

A portion of all sales will be donated to the local faction of Planned Parenthood and the Stanley B. Keith Social Justice Center.
