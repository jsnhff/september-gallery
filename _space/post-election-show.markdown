Exhibition Co-Organized by Kristen Dodge and Kate Gilmore. Opening Saturday, January 28, 2017. Event programming begins at 3pm. Opening Day Co-Organized by Lauren Barnes and Shanekia McIntosh.
Exhibition Dates: January 28 - March 5, 2017

SEPTEMBER presents <i>POST-ELECTION</i>, an exhibition of over 170 artists, co-organized by Kristen Dodge and Kate Gilmore. This exhibition was conceived in conversation between Kristen and Kate a few days after the U.S. Presidential Election. With the intention of providing a reason, space, and context for artists to respond to the current circumstance, they agreed to set a show in motion, and allow the call to take on a life of its own. Word spread between artists and within a short time, the number of participants rose from 50 to 170. The current list is included below.

If you choose to make a work that addresses things internal, or external, or some state in-between, that is up to you. Make what you need to make in whatever form, and at whatever pitch you choose.
-Excerpt from the call to participate

If we stop to comprehend the “unrealistic” endeavors that we pursue, we would never do them. This show has been a leap of faith and a truly collaborative endeavor. We are grateful to everyone who has offered her time and resources along the way. 

10% of all sales will be donated to Upper Hudson Planned Parenthood and the Stanley B. Keith Social Justice Center.
