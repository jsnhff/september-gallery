<i>Post-Election</i>

Exhibition Co-Organized by Kristen Dodge and Kate Gilmore. Opening Saturday, January 28, Event programming begins at 2pm. Opening Day Co-Organized by Lauren Barnes and Shanekia McIntosh.
Exhibition Dates: January 28 - March 5, 2017

SEPTEMBER presents Post-Election, an exhibition of over 170 artists, co-organized by Kristen Dodge
and Kate Gilmore. This exhibition was conceived in conversation between Kristen and Kate a few days
after the U.S. Presidential Election. With the intention of providing a reason, space, and context for artists to respond to the current circumstance, they agreed to set a show in motion, and allow the call to take on a life of its own. Word spread between artists and within a short time, the number of participants rose from 50 to 150. The current list, now at over 170 artists, is included below.

If you choose to make a work that addresses things internal, or external, or some state in-between, that is up to you. Make what you need to make in whatever form, and at whatever pitch you choose. -Excerpt from the call to participate.

If we stop to comprehend the “unrealistic” endeavors that we pursue, we would never do them. This show has been a leap of faith and a truly collaborative endeavor.

Lauren Barnes and Shanekia McIntosh are organizing the opening day of performances, talks, and
events. Carrie Schneider is managing new media submissions. Courtney Childress, Sheree Hovespain,
Eleanor King, Gina Magid, Carleen Sheehan, Elise Siegel, and Ana Wolovick are providing drop-off
locations for participating artists. Lilah Friedland is managing the collection of works in collaboration with our staff. Many participating artists have personally shipped their work to the gallery and offered their time and resources. A portion of all sales will be donated to the local factions of Planned Parenthood and Black Lives Matter.
