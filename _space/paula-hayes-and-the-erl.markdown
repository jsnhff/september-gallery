Aren't the most important tools of today those of real desire, inspiration, inclusiveness, and shared time? As a species we have to deeply desire to live in order to continue living, protecting life, as we decipher what technology and speed actually does to our connection to each other and the environment. It would be fabulous to enjoy time together, in shared rhythm or at a pace of elongated presence, not rushing our demise but continuing because we really want to. –ERL

Opening January 6, 2018 at SEPTEMBER: I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together: 
PAULA HAYES AND THE ERL. The Existential Reformation League is a collaboration between current members Paula Hayes and Teo Camporeale
 
What happens when we leave the frenetic bustle of identifying with doing to a point of not knowing who and where we are beyond the affirmation of a hyper schedule and with that, necessary efficiency that keeps possibility, discovery, and uncertainty at bay? What happens when we yank the break and disappear for a while? At different times, and in our own ways, the artists and the art dealer went north, discarded old habits and habits, the ways we were, what we wore, and cloaked our lives with receptivity, discerning a quietude and connectedness that is becoming our nature, in nature. A more natural state with senses awake. 

Paula Hayes has always asked us to care for her work, invited the viewer to imagine complicity, and demanded the collector to enact participation and responsibility. We must be “dedicated caretakers.” Hayes art is living, ever changing. It is part of, not coolly separate from us. The maker, the art, the caretaker are in a continuous exchange. 

At SEPTEMBER, Hayes has created a new environment, offering paths for visitors to walk about her populated landscapes of playfully orchestrated objects from silicone vessels to rocks to plants to clay to aluminum- her creatures intermingle. A whole is a sum of its parts. 

Linked with Hayes installation are works by the Existential Reformation League, a collaborative that seeks to “prepare for a different perception of time in the space of a different earth.” An animation, sound pieces and digital collages enliven the walls and our ears with colorful, nonsensical, energetic riffs of movement and sound. Projected, the animation invokes the aliveness of Hayes works by invoking her sculptures as energized forms becoming both more real in their animation, and more imaginary as digital renderings. The space in-between. The ERL’s screen-sized collages are a collaborative high-pitch of color, image, and line layered with spontaneity and humor. Each collage has it’s own accompanying sound piece, a voice to guide us- not in an explanatory effort (words are chopped, layered and distorted) but as an invitation to expand our experience outwards and inwards simultaneously. Where are we? 

Now is a time of collectivity: collecting ourselves and collectively existing. The intermixed exchanges and non-singularity of Hayes and the ERL installation both illustrate and act in a coexistent, non-linear space that hits an essential core of connectivity. Imagine the possibilities. I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together.
