SEPTEMBER is thrilled to present 'My flaws are my pets,' a solo exhibition of paintings by Reginald Madison, opening Saturday, July 23, 5-7pm. Connecting to Madison’s first solo exhibition with the gallery in Hudson one year ago, 'My flaws are my pets' is a collection of oil paintings from recent decades. The selection represents Madison’s lifelong interest in working at varying scales from large to handheld, and working on a range of mostly found surfaces, including paper, canvas, and panel.


For Madison, the process of painting is one of courting risk and trusting the unknown. Madison never sets out with a predetermined subject, and allows the painting to reveal
itself along the way. If there are starting points for Madison, they are purely visual rather than referential. He often begins with older work, sometimes literally, and other times pulls imagery and expands from there. Madison’s vocabulary includes figures, faces, handprints and shapes that partially resemble form but lean into abstraction. 

Texture is the foundation for Madison and color is king. Color determines where things start and stop, how edges form, and what Madison calls the friendly or unfriendly mood of a painting. Ultimately, he is motivated by a “distrust in niceness,” often painting to complex music that sets a challenging standard. He prefers disturbed surfaces- tar
unevenly applied, banged up wood, hemmed drop cloths, and gritty linen. His process is physical and messy. And the results are wonderfully askew and impolite.
