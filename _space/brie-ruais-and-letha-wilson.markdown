The landscape is there, overcoming our vision, supporting our steps, entering our pores, holding a space in our memory. 
 
Have you stood at the edge of a cliff at sunset? Have you seen yourself smaller than you know yourself to be? A speck in the rolling terrain of sand below.
 
<i>It’s not about you as a figure looking across the land, instead you are inside the picture plane itself and become one of its many striations.</i>
 
I know it’s not possible to take the landscape with me, to carry it home. The land can’t be separated from itself. I can’t separate from the land. I leave a part of myself there, drifting dust held in a beam of light, floating untethered.
 
<i>I got lost here.</i>
 
The images I carry home and cut, fold, crease, cast. Over here I am inlaying a sunset, a dessert-scape, a canyon crevasse, holding it, repeating it, casting it into a thing heavy, dense, held tight. This is where I keep it all. Printing and imprinted.
 
<i>Something about body and translation of experience through it…Is the mark of the hand a way of claiming your presence as a body and in actual space? That you were there?*</i>
 
The earth I push under my fingernails, into my pours, against the balls of my feet. I push up, out, past, down, over and over. Fist prints, foot kicks. Shaping, molding, making below the plane, at the surface, a horizontal field. Maintaining the boundaries of my own reach.
 
<i>Always keep a part of your body fixed in the center.**</i>
