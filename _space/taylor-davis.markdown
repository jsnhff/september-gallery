SEPTEMBER is proud to present REDGREENBLACKSWHITES, a solo exhibition with Taylor Davis. This is the gallery’s first solo presentation of our programming and the third solo exhibition of Taylor Davis’s work exhibited by Kristen Dodge. 

Davis will present REDGREENBLACKSWHITES, a new body of work that uses color and gravity as the central components. In addition to her collaged mobiles of airplane grade birch plywood, Davis will also present a new form of text work, caption a/b, a two-sided floor piece that stretches (and divides) the length of the gallery.

Notes on REDGREENBLACKSWHITES:

<i>In June 2015 I began to work on pairs of small rectangular gouaches in red, green, black, and white. More than twice the length of their width, these paintings hung from their top left corner, the longer measurement pulling the rectangles off axis.

<i>I was looking for a two-part composition that was equally in relation to the plumb-line of my standing body and the outlines of the objects’ hanging shapes. I was, am, thinking about the difficulty and complexity of balance; how the stronger a contrast is between forms or colors (between individuals or groups), the more powerful and destabilizing the pull is in one direction or another.

<i>Red & green and black & white contrast visually and semantically. In addition to the differing optical sensations of light & dark and warm & cool, there’s a contrast in what the colors’ relationships signify: stop and go, yes and no, on and off, day and night, queer and straight, black and white.

<i>In these REDGREENBLACKWHITES (now oil paint on canvas over round-edged poplar stretchers), the visual, semantic, and political contrasts exist with each other, concomitant; creating an indivisible sum necessarily reliant on diverse color, shape, form, and meaning.
