Slipping in Swallow Bondage
Back of Neck Willies
Between The Moon the Cistern and the Column
Corseted Crescent
Shroud reveals to Void Vase
Crawling While It OpenUp
Making More Tired
Road Trip Nap Time Ear Lobe
Saw Sneeries
Road Trip Nap Time Donuts
Walled In the Wall
Window Willies
Aerial Onslaught
Coming out the Wall
Ceiling looks like rain
Road Trip Projected
Willies on the Couch
Sex on the Couch
Willies out the Door
Trees are Sneering
Rawed out Bedtime

Power takes all the chunks and rearranges them- There’s a cistern, a column and a cresent. The Column Cracks, the Moon Crescents, the Cistern Spills. The Cistern spills the Column Cracks and the Moon Crescents. The Moon removes its shroud, the Cistern Spills and the Column Cracks. “Baby if you give it to me / I’ll give it to you / I know what you want / You know I got it” (1). If they abide by laws of matter.

*Real Puss Technologies* (patent pending) A jumpsuit that has replicated vaginal flesh sewn in patches along any fuckable crease in the body. Get fucked anywhere everywhere. Fuck the air you breath before it enters your body (douse with vaseline prior to use).

"Bump slide into the gorgeous busty neighbor who you follow at the super market or watch at the gym." (2)

The moon in the clouds is “like the hand of a dead woman who is seeking to cover herself with a shroud”(3). And you shroud too, the shroud of a real puss jumpsuit.
