> `        A woman who adored her mother, and had mourned her death every day for years now, came
across some postcards in a store that sold antiques and other bric-a-brac. The postcards were of unexceptional scenes, but she was drawn to them and purchased several of wild beaches and forests roads. When she got home, she experienced an overwhelming need to send a card to her mother.
	What she wrote was not important. It was the need that was important.
	She put the card in an envelope and sent it to her mother’s last earthly address, a modest farmhouse that had long since been sold and probably sold again.
	Within a week she received a letter, the writing on the envelope was unmistakably her mother’s. Even the green ink her mother had favored was the same. 
	The woman never opened the letter, nor did she send any other postcards to that address.
	The letter, in time, though only rumored to be, caused her children, though grown, much worry.
POSTCARD by Joy Williams`


SEPTEMBER is pleased to present *GONE HERE* a solo exhibition of Sheila Gallagher’s newest work.

A meditation on healing and haunting, things that go away and come back – the recipe for concrete, the stories of the dead, crafts and cures- Gallagher draws upon diverse sources including Shaker gift drawings, Aesclipion temples of ancient Greece, and recent archeological findings of mass graves at Irish orphanages, to create an installation of dedicatory phenomenon, petition and remembrance. 

Across the gallery, a shrine, videos, a plastic painting, a collage of 789 cut-outs, lace drawings and hundreds of anatomical clay fragments speak to each other in voices that are both funny and tragic. Gallagher’s fluency in the language of materiality enables her to create a sensory landscape of objects and images, which bear emotional charges and historical sedimentation. GONE HERE poses crucial questions about our collective sensory memory: What role can the art object play in healing and restoring memory in our increasingly amnesiac and disembodied lives?

For further information, please visit the gallery in Hudson, or contact Kristen@septembergallery.com.
