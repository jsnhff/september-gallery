SEPTEMBER is thrilled to present, *Moth*, a single channel animation by Allison Schulnik, that will be projected onto the main wall of the gallery. *Moth* is a culmination of hundreds of gouache paintings created over the course of 14 months. The animation is one of transformation, subjects mutating forms, never stationary, ever transient. We are living in a time of significant change, navigating cultural shifts, and an unprecedented pandemic. The only constant seems to be change in the form of new circumstances, new information, and new decisions. In order to grow, to survive, adaptation is necessary. Moth is a mesmerizing distillation of impermanence, the symbiotic nature of life and death, and the ever present truth of temporality. Schulnik gives humans, animals, serpents and landscapes equivalence, each a centralized subjects for a time, each dissolving into a new form.
