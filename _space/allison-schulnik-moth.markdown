SEPTEMBER is thrilled to present, *Moth*, a single channel animation by Allison Schulnik that will be projected onto the main wall of the gallery. *Moth* is a culmination of hundreds of gouache paintings created over the course of 14 months by Schulnik in her desert CA studio. The immersive visual and auditory experience is enthralling and all too brief. 

Schulnik's animation is a rich study of transformation with subjects mutating forms- never stationary, ever transient. Schulnik gives humans, animals, serpents and landscapes equal significance, making each a centralized subject for a brief time. Each animated character evolves rapidly and soon dissolves into a new, temporary form. 

We are living in a time of significant change, navigating sociopolitical rifts, and an unfolding pandemic. The only constant seems to be change. And while it has always been true, it has become acutely apparent that adaptation is necessary in order to survive. 

*Moth* is a mesmerizing distillation of impermanence, rolling illustration of the symbiotic relationship of life and death. The flickering and fleeting nature of Schulnik's animation is a poignant meditation on temporality of all existence.
