SEPTEMBER is thrilled to present, *Moth*, a single channel animation by Allison Schulnik that will be projected onto the main wall of the gallery. *Moth* is a culmination of hundreds of gouache paintings created over the course of 14 months by Schulnik in her desert CA studio. The animation is one of transformation with subjects mutating forms- never stationary, ever transient. We are living in a time of significant change, navigating cultural rifts and shifts, and an unprecedented pandemic. The only constant seems to be change. In order to grow and to survive, adaptation is necessary. *Moth* is a mesmerizing distillation of impermanence, a beautiful, rolling illustration of the symbiotic relationship of life and death. Schulnik gives humans, animals, serpents and landscapes equal significance, each a centralized subject for a brief time, evolving and soon dissolving forms. The flickering and fleeting nature of Schulnik's animation is a flickering meditation on temporality.
