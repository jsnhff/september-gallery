The NADA team has been working from home since March 11th, and in that time many of our member galleries have closed their doors to the public. For many the business of art has largely been placed on pause – with exhibitions postponed or cancelled – resulting in uncertainty about how to continue covering the expenses of rent for their spaces and salaries for their staff.

In response to this set of challenging circumstances, we have petitioned for relief in NYC, advocated for rent suspension through the New York Senate, and now we are establishing the NADA Gallery Relief Fund, an initiative to offer grants supporting commercial art galleries, non-profits, and alternative spaces working with contemporary art that have been deeply impacted by the COVID-19 crisis.

Art galleries – open to the public year round – are small businesses, employers, and platforms for artists, curators, and art workers internationally. These essential sites for cultural exchange are central to the cultural fabric of the arts ecosystem and are in need of support.

If you are in the position to do so, we ask you to consider making a donation to the NADA Gallery Relief Fund today. Donations are made tax-deductible through our fiscal sponsor, Independent Curators International (ICI).
