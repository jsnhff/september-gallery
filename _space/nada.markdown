SEPTEMBER presents a solo exhibition of new work by Brooklyn-based artist Odessa Straub. The sixth edition of NADA New York will take place March 2–5, 2017, at Skylight Clarkson North, located at 572 Washington Street.

Head-Shoulders-Knees-Toes-Hot rain on pavement. Back of the neck-Intestines Upstairs Bowling ball hits the floor. Just a warm squishy laying there awake sucking bingo balls up into attention. A hammer looking back at the user isn’t enough retribution for the swinging; it’s just a little boy erection on stage.  
 
Odessa's new works pivot around the idea of retributive punishment. A visual accumulation of disembodied forms morph into familiar shapes, flirt with narrative, and dispense into abstraction and materiality. Wool, leather, latex, oil paint, vinyl, plexiglass, and resin conglomerate over canvas. No material presence overrides the composition of visual form. Literal textures and dimension shadow shapes and figurative associations. Turtle shells on tires stack and tile the floor. Points of tension and unease pervade, like brain fog.
