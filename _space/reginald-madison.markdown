<b>Reginald Madison</b> (b. 1941, Chicago, IL) is a painter and sculptor. In his early years, Madison was greatly influenced by his parents’ love of jazz and the stories they told of seeing Sun-Ra at the legendary Club DeLisa on Chicago’s south side, and by the family’s frequent trips to the Art Institute of Chicago and the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago. In 1970, Madison was invited to participate in an art show that established him in the emerging arts scene in Chicago, and he went on to travel and study art independently in Paris, Venice, and Copenhagen. He was represented by Phyllis Kind Gallery, NYC after moving to Western Massachusetts in the 1970s.

His work has been exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago, Historic Hudson Hall, the Ace Hotel Chicago, SEPTEMBER Gallery, and CR10 Arts, among others. In 2020 Madison curated Art & Soul, an exhibition at Historic Hudson Hall that included the work of David Hammons and Tschabalala Self, among others. He also organized Melodius Thunk, a Jazz Music Festival on the waterfront in Hudson, NY, 2021. Madison is a 2021 recipient of the NEA Artist Residency at Basilica Hudson. His work has recently been acquired by the Beth Rudin DeWoody Collection. Madison currently lives and works in Hudson, NY.
