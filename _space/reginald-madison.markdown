The National Endowment for the Arts supports exemplary arts projects in communities nationwide. Madison is a recipient of the NEA grant for his residency at Basilica, Hudson.

**Reginald Madison** (b. 1941, Chicago, IL) is a painter and sculptor. In his early years, Madison was greatly influenced by his parents’ love of jazz and the stories they told of seeing Sun-Ra at the legendary Club DeLisa on Chicago’s south side, and by the family’s frequent trips to the Art Institute of Chicago and the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago. In 1970, Madison was invited to participate in an art show that established him in the emerging arts scene in Chicago, and he went on to travel and study art independently in Paris, Venice, and Copenhagen. He was represented by Phyllis Kind Gallery, NYC after moving to Western Massachusetts in the 1970s.

Madison’s work has been exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago, Historic Hudson Hall, the Ace Hotel Chicago, Phyllis Kind Gallery, Port Washington Public Library, SEPTEMBER Gallery, Montserrat College of Art, CR10 Arts, among others. In 2020 Madison curated Art & Soul, an exhibition at Historic Hudson Hall that included the work of David Hammons and Tschabalala Self, among others. He is the co-organizer of Melodius Thunk, a Jazz Music Festival in Hudson, NY. Madison is the 2021 recipient of the NEA Artist Residency at Basilica Hudson. His work has been featured in Art & Antiques, Chronogram, The Rogovoy Report, Times Union, among others. Madison’s work is in the collection of UC Santa Barbara, and has recently been acquired by the Beth Rudin DeWoody Collection. Madison currently lives and works in Hudson, NY.
