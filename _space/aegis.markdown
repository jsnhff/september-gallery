SEPTEMBER is pleased to present, Aegis, a solo exhibition with Ashley Garrett. The exhibition will include over fifteen of her smallest paintings, measuring 4 x 6 inches, and 2-4 of her largest paintings, measuring 94 x 57 inches. The two scales mark the physical extremity of her practice, demonstrating her interest in both intimate and distant perspectives. Regardless of the dimension of her surface, and evident in the attentiveness of her mark-making, Garrettâ€™s gaze maintains intense proximity. The detail of her work is not achieved through rendering but through the varying movement and scale of brushwork, as well as congested interaction of color. These are abstracted landscapes derived not from nature (though the outdoors deeply impacts Garrett and literally surround her studio) but from an emotive and psychological space.
