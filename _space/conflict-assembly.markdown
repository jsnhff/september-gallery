SEPTEMBER is pleased to announce CONFLICT ASSEMBLY, the gallery’s inaugural group show at its new location in Kinderhook, New York. Organized by Olga Dekalo and Kristen Dodge the exhibition is a survey of eight contemporary practices based in the Hudson Valley and Western Massachusetts. A.K. Burns, Liz Magic Laser, Sara Magenheimer, Sahra Motalebi, Em Rooney, Carrie Schneider, Kianja Strobert and Sam Vernon present several through lines including a reclamation of language, rhetorical power, and material friction. 

**A.K. Burns**’ recent body of hand-ladled glass works are compositions of material distress. The reliefs are created by combining molten glass with objects such as leather gloves, old jeans, rope, pine cones, and paper bags that combust in the melting process, leaving an imprint in the surface. The immense pressure involved in the casting method produces fissures and fractures within the glass, creating a mirror that is actively working against itself and the viewer. The series' title "Burn Out" sums up the volatility of the material interaction as it also alludes to a state of exhaustion that results from an onslaught of psychological and physical demand.

**Liz Magic Laser** presents a new video sculpture titled "Neck and Neck" that highlights the use of fashion as propaganda by politicians using elements as simple as the scarf. A video projected directly onto an abstracted head shows the hands of a fashion stylist dressing a statue of Martin van Buren—the eighth U.S. President who was born and largely resided in Kinderhook. Van Buren is adorned in a sequence of neckwear deployed by American politicians over the past two hundred years to broadcast their class affiliations and support of specific causes and cultures. Van Buren’s continuous makeover traces a timeline of political garb from President Thomas Jefferson’s aristocratic white scarf to the Kente clothes worn by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to display their solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The commemorative Van Buren sculpture seen in the video is located in the town center directly outside the gallery wall.

"Handle / Poignée" (2018) is a video work in which Laser’s Movement Consultants guide viewers through therapeutic choreographies developed to empower four archetypes: the disciplinary parent, the nurturing parent, the rebellious child, and the obedient child, loosely drawn from George Lakoff’s book "Moral Politics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think" (1996). The consultants inhabit a colorful Venn diagram stage that symbolizes the overlapping spheres of home, work, and politics in Laser’s political cosmology. The choreographies were developed with dancers and movement therapists specialized in Body Mind Centering and shamanic dance practices. Laser’s somatic diagnostics refer to specific political moments such as Donald Trump and Emmanuel Macron’s prolonged handshake. The live interactive iteration of "Handle / Poignée" was staged daily in the lobby of the Centre Pompidou, where museum-goers took Laser’s “personality test” and participated in movement therapy treatments.*

Building on an extensive body of work engaged with words and images—typically as they perform on the screen and the page—**Sara Magenheimer**’s new series of paintings titled "HA HA" exemplify the artist’s collagist and layered interest in the plasticity of signs. Made with materials that include muslin, thread and organza, the compositions sensationally and authoritatively emphasize the artist’s hand manipulated letterforms. By deploying her own shorthand and koan-like phrasing, Magenheimer invites us to consider how we create and participate in  spectacle culture. 

**Sahra Motalebi**’s scenographic installations reflect the artist’s long standing interest in the history of performance as it relates to the built environment. The voice-sculptures "Diagram(s) for an Empty Stage 04, 05.1" and "05.2" are 'stages' that are combined into a single work. Presented at differing scales, the elements of the maquette and the architectural screen convey a relationship between two dislocated vocal performances that can be heard by way of QR code within participants’ own mobile devices. By reconfiguring the experience of staging, Motalebi examines the nature and function of the set in the era of digital networks, dematerialization, and the Self.

Building on a practice concerned with materiality, touch, and the ethics of care, **Em Rooney** presents never before exhibited stand-alone ceramic sculptures constructed out of steel, porcelain, aluminum, paint, flowers and cow teeth. The series titled "Love Smells like Death" (2021) exemplifies the artist’s focus on women in film, and draws inspiration from a single cinematic image in David Cronenberg’s film "M. Butterfly" (1993)—the moment when Jeremy Irons' character observes an ornate cage used for dragonfly trapping as he leaves Butterfly’s home. By distilling the film’s narrative of transformation, deception, and feminine control into sculptural compositions, Rooney extends a lineage of fashioning structures and frames that support and armor ensnared subjects. 

Made with a hand-built Frankencamera, **Carrie Schneider**’s new large-scale photographic works deploy the artist’s evolving in-camera technique of direct, multiple exposure of color photo paper. Affixed directly on the wall, the multi-panel scroll "Failed to note" is an amalgamation of personal, art historical and film references that pervade this new series. Pushed beyond visual cognizance, the motifs in the work "when the body says yes" can be seen through a lens of the ravenous and red-eye conditions of the artist’s production, occurring in the dark, early hours. Collectively, the works are mediations between matter, bodies, and technology; taking the medium into a lively dialogue within the affective means of image making.

**Kianja Strobert**’s new multi-media work is situated within her practice of drawing from popular archival imagery to revisit and reframe the permeating effects of modernism on contemporary culture. In one of two images, a woman—famous and equally anonymous—is captured screaming in a field of color. The second, mirroring piece replaces the image with a flower. The swift change in emotional register locates the audience in a moment between two extremes; reproducing the fractured experience of media as consumed by today's audiences. Complicated by the repetition of assembled and collaged elements, the tenor of the work explores a particular madness of the visible and irreconcilable modes of representation.

**Sam Vernon** works with installation and performance to honor the past while revising historical memory. Using Matt Richardson’s 2013 publication "The Queer Limit of Black Memory" as a critical entry point, Vernon drapes digitally printed fabric and creates a constellation of made and found images. Shown as a site-specific installation for the first time, the mixed media piece titled "The Body as a Text" integrates two recent bodies of work comprised of the artist’s Xeroxed drawings, photographs, paintings and sculptural components as well as discernible imagery and text from San Francisco-based first journal of Black studies and research, THE BLACK SCHOLAR. Reflecting the publication’s openness to different forms and techniques of academics, activists and artists, the work is a grid of what the artist calls a “visual friction” that engages the viewer through its directive to know and comprehend the larger emancipatory project of Black scholarship. The accompanying prints "Ughosts" and "Xdrops" (both 2020), are from a twenty-six monoprint series that illustrate a stark and haunting meditation in black, white, and gray that Vernon considers a “dreamed-up collaboration” and an homage to Afro-Cuban printmaker Belkis Ayón (1967 - 1999).
