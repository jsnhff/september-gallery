September is pleased to present the inaugural Young Hudson Biennial, opening Saturday, October 5, 2019. Over 30 studio visits were conducted, and over 40 artists under the age of 35 were considered for this exhibition. All of these artists live within the immediate radius of Hudson, NY, and all have been living and working in the area for at least a year, many for several years.

Nine artists have been selected to represent the inaugural Young Hudson Biennial, along with seven artists who will perform on the evening of October 31. The participating artists explore connections between interiority, intimacy, anxiety, and the political, while simultaneously engaging in the subversive act of exploring the pleasure of pure aesthetic experience. The work included in the exhibition spans several disciplines from film, performance, sculpture, interactive installations, photography, painting, to mixed media works. More than a few of the artists have fluid interdisciplinary practices that skirt easy definition. 

Demonstrating the steadily growing creative force in Hudson, the artists in YHB as well as those considered for the show, actively support each other's practices. They pull from, and give back energy to the spirit of community, building a steadying, collective intention to uncertain times.

SEPTEMBER would like to thank all of the artists who welcomed us into their studios and shared their practices with us over recent months. 

Lil' Deb's Oasis' installation will feature pieces by Objects-in-the-Round, Body Language Shop, Like-Minded Objects, Becca Van K, and Goodfight Herb Company.
