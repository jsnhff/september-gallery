Born in Tehran, Iran, Khorramian lives and works in upstate New York. She studied at the Rhode Island School of Design and received her undergraduate degree at The School of The Art Institute of Chicago, and her MFA at Columbia University, New York. Khorramian has exhibited internationally, including shows in MASS MOCA, U.S.A; Victoria and Albert Museum, London; Art Basel Statements, Switzerland; Ballroom Marfa, Texas; Istanbul Museum of Art, Istanbul; The Sundance Film festival; The Midnight Moment in Times Sq and The Queensland Art Gallery, Australia. In 2013, she published her first limited edition artist book Include Amplified Toilet Water with publisher Bartleby and Co, Brussels. Khorramian is the recipient of the Baltic Artists' Award 2021. She is also the recipient of the Foundation for Contemporary Arts Emergency Grant 2020.

In her art practice Khorramian uses animation, digital media and sampled audio supplements with collages, monotypes and drawing. Khorramian approaches her work as a series of experiments with the process of chance as a starting point for discovering possibilities of the unknown, whose details and outcomes she then investigates and repositions. In a vacillating process between macro and micro views of painted landscapes and incidental spaces, Khorramian integrates fiction with spectacle and theater to explore the transience of living matter and beings and it's cycles of depletion and plenitude.
