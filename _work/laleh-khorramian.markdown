She has participated in numerous group exhibitions, including Subliminal Horizons, Alexander Gray Associates (Germantown, NY), The Creative Act: Performance, Process, Presence, Guggenheim (Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates), Statements, Art Basel (Basel, Switzerland), Making Room: The Space Between Two- and Three- Dimensions, MASS MoCA (North Adams, MA), Immaterial, Ballroom Marfa (Marfa, TX), The Dissolve, Site Santa Fe Biennale (Santa Fe, NM), New Frontier Shorts, Sundance Film Festival (Park City, UT), RAAD O BARGH, Thaddaeus Ropac Gallery (Salzburg, Austria), Unveiled, Saatchi Gallery (London, United Kingdom), and Greater NY 2005, MoMA P.S.1 Museum (Long Island, NY). In 2012, she published Include Amplified Toilet Water (artist book, edition of 33, Bartleby and Co. Publishers, Brussels, Belgium), and it is housed in the collections of MoMA (New York, NY) Centre Pompidou (Paris, France), Columbia University (New York, NY), and the Royal Library of Belgium (Brussels, Belgium). Select awards include the BALTIC Artists’ Award, the Pollock Krasner Foundation Grant, the Pat Hearn and Colin Deland Foundation Grant, and the Agnes Martin Award. Select press includes features in Art21, The New York Times T Magazine, Hyperallergic, and The Creative Independent. Laleh Khorramian lives and works in upstate New York.

In her art practice, Khorramian uses animation, digital media, and sampled audio supplements with collages, monotypes, and drawing. Khorramian approaches her work as a series of experiments with the process of chance as a starting point for discovering possibilities of the unknown, whose details and outcomes she then investigates and repositions. In a vacillating process between macro and micro views of painted landscapes and incidental spaces, Khorramian integrates fiction with spectacle and theater to explore the transience of living matter and beings and its cycles of depletion and plenitude.
