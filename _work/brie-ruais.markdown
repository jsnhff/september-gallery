Brie Ruais (b. 1982, Southern California) received her MFA from Columbia University in 2011. Working primarily with clay, Ruais makes large-scale ceramic floor and wall pieces that covet their own self-sufficiency. Often beginning with a mass of clay that equals her body weight, the scripted actions employed result in forms that speak to the movement of bodies. Her work has been exhibited at Nicole Klagsbrun, New York; Marc Selwyn Fine Arts, Los Angeles; Lefebvre & Fils Gallery, Paris; Fused Space, San Francisco; Cooper Cole, Toronto; Halsey McKay, East Hampton; Xavier Hufkens, Brussels; The Horticultural Society, New York; Salon 94, New York; and The Abrons Arts Center, New York; Mesler/Feuer, New York; Maccarone, New York; Sperone Westwater, New York. Ruais is the recipient of The Socrates EAF Fellowship, The Shandaken Project Residency,the Abrons Arts Center Residency, and the dieu Donne papermaking residency.
