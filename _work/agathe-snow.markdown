Agathe Snow
b. 1976, Corsica, France
Lives and works in Mattituck, New York

Agathe Snow’s protean art practice includes installation, performance, sculpture, and writing. Informed by instances of personal experience to current events, her narratives address topics of consumer culture and its contribution to societal breakdown and environmental collapse. Her work engages connected themes of change and community, and in the early ’00s, this often took the form of dinner parties (organized with her sister and performance artist Marianne Vitale), dance marathons, and social invasions, among other carnivalesque happenings.
 
Snow has long considered the redemptive power of human ingenuity through a variety of mediums. Her low-tech approach to two and three-dimensional work involves assemblage of simple items, found objects and detritus, which she transforms using paint, plaster, and fiberglass, for example. Her spontaneous totems are as much about moral decay as they are monuments to optimism. The playful innovation she employs in constructing the work rescues decrepit and common materials, suggesting a new characterization and cause for celebration.
 
Agathe Snow (b. 1976, Corsica, France) lives and works in Long Island, NY. She has shown nationally at the New Museum, New York, NY; the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, NY; and Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, NY. Snow has also achieved international recognition, exhibiting at several prestigious institutions, such as Deutsche Guggenheim, Berlin, Germany; Jeu de Paume, Paris, France; Palais de Tokyo, Paris, France; and Saatchi Gallery, London, UK. Snow’s work is included in the permanent collection of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, NY; the Charles Saatchi Collection, London, UK; the Zabludowitz Collection; and in the Dikeou Collection, Denver, CO.
