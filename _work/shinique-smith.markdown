Born 1971 in Baltimore, Maryland, Shinique Smith lives and works in Upstate New York. Her work is inspired by the vast nature of ‘things’ that we consume and discard, which resonate on a personal and social scale. The Graffiti of her youth, Japanese calligraphy, and Abstraction are influences from which she extracts “the graceful and spiritual qualities in written word and the everyday.”

Smith’s work has been exhibited in numerous exhibitions including The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, The Brooklyn Museum of Art, Denver Art Museum, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Madison Museum of Contemporary Art (Madison WI), The Bronx Museum of the Arts, The Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery (Washington DC), Yerba Buena Contemporary Arts Center, CAC New Orleans, The New Museum (New York), MOMA/PS1 (New York), and The Studio Museum in Harlem among others.

Currently on view through September, is a new monumental sculptural installation featured in Hauser, Wirth + Schimmel Gallery’s inaugural exhibition, Revolution in the Making: Abstract Sculpture by Women, 1947 – 2016 in Los Angeles, and Smith’s site-specific mural for Aspen Art Museum at Elk Camp in Snowmass in Colorado.

Smith earned her BFA (1992) & MFA (2003) from Maryland Institute College of Art, where she now serves on the Board of Trustees and her MAT (2000) from The School of the Museum of Fine Arts and Tufts University.

Smith is represented by David Castillo Gallery in Miami and Brand New Gallery in Milan, Italy.
