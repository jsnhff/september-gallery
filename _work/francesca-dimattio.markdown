Francesca DiMattio (born 1981) is an American artist born and based in New York City. She makes paintings that weave spaces using architectural, design, cultural and historical references. Patterns, textures and imagery combine to forge a logical cohesion from apparently disparate and chaotic elements. Larger mural works on canvas have been displayed in the Saatchi Gallery in London, Locust Projects in Miami, Salon 94 Bowery in NYC and the ICA in Boston. Through painting and the hybridizing of art and craft she has introduced a new dialogue with the past that has enlivened the contemporary world art scene. She received her BFA from the Cooper Union and MFA from Columbia University of the Arts in 2005.
