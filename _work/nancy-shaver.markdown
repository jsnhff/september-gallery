Wanting to be an artist. Being an artist. For forty years I have used the vernacular mass-market object and the hand-made as the site for my work. I would like the work to slip between boundaries, from a recognized use in the world to another experience of thought or pleasure.

Color is the vehicle for this change.

The vernacular object, the subject, can become a marker for reflection on our American experience. We are mass-market consumers. But was well, people of all stripes, who desire to make things with our own hands.

This is my field.
